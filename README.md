# SUMMARY

Built on top of Spark, MLlib is a scalable machine learning library consisting of common learning algorithms and utilities, including classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and underlying optimization primitives. Learning the streaming data from social media platforms such as Twitter and applying machine learning techniques such as classification algorithms and pattern recognition using big data analytics tools such as Spark. tweepy was used to work with streaming data. Tweets are received using the Twitter Stream Listener and the Model is trained using a train data, without transferring them directly to the model. After the Sentiment Analysis is completed, the results are exported in csv format.
